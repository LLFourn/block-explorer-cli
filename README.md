# A CLI block explorer for mempool.space websocket

This is an initial approach in building a cli interface for consuming and streaming blocks, transactions and mempool statistics from [mempool.space websocket API](https://mempool.space/docs/api/websocket).

## Executing - WIP

And you can execute the code with the following command:

``` sh
cargo run
```

Or for testnet:

``` sh
cargo run -- --endpoint mempool.space/testnet/api
```
